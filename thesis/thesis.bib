	abstract = {GPS-enabled devices, including vehicles, smartphones, wearable and tracking devices, as well as various check-in and social network data are continuously producing tremendous amounts of trajectory data, which are used consistently in many applications such as urban planning and map inference. Existing techniques for trajectory data imputation rely heavily on the existing maps to perform map-matching operations. However, modern applications such as map construction and map update assume no map exists. In this paper, we propose GTI - a scalable graph-based trajectory imputation approach for trajectory data completion. GTI relies on cross-trajectory imputation, as it exploits "mutual information" of the aggregated knowledge of all input sparse trajectories to impute the missing data for each single one of them. GTI can act as a pre-processing step for any trajectory data management system or trajectory-based application, as it takes raw sparse trajectory data as its input and outputs dense imputed trajectory data that significantly increase the accuracy of different systems that consume trajectory data. We evaluate GTI on junction-scale as well as city-scale real datasets. In addition, GTI is used as a pre-processing step in multiple trajectory-based applications and it boosts the accuracy across these applications compared with the state-of-the-art work.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of ubiquitous location-aware devices and mobile Internet enables us to collect massive individual-level trajectory dataset from users. Such trajectory big data bring new opportunities to human mobility research but also raise public concerns with regard to location privacy. In this work, we present the Conditional Adversarial Trajectory Synthesis (CATS), a deep-learning-based GeoAI methodological framework for privacy-preserving trajectory data generation and publication. CATS applies K-anonymity to the underlying spatiotemporal distributions of human movements, which provides a distributional-level strong privacy guarantee. By leveraging conditional adversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global context learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite graph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct trajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate high-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as supplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data publication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our method has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal characteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline methods, which brings new insights into privacy-preserving human mobility research using generative AI techniques and explores data ethics issues in GIScience.},

	abstract = {Areview of research that has been carried out on data mining and visual analysis of movement patterns suggests that there is little agreement on the relevant types of movement patterns and only few, isolated definitions of these exist. Since the research interest in this area has recently started to soar, we believe that this is a good time to approach the definition of movement patterns in a more systematic and comprehensive way. This paper intends to contribute to the development of a toolbox of data mining algorithms and visual analytic techniques for movement analysis by developing firstly a conceptual frame-work for movement behavior of different moving objects and secondly a comprehensive classification and review of movement patterns. We argue that this is indispensable as a basis for the development of pattern recognition and information visualization algorithms that are required to be efficient (i.e. usable on massive data sets), effective (i.e. capable of accurately detecting patterns not artifacts), and as generic as possible (i.e. potentially applicable to different types of movement data). We demonstrate the utilization of our classification by answering the question as to what extent eye tracking data can be seen as a proxy of other types of movement data. We have set up a moderated discussion platform in order to facilitate the further evolution of our proposed classification towards a consolidated taxonomy in a consensus process.},

In the context of human geography a trajectory or space‚Äìtime activity of humans is not predefined, but a result of constraints and decisions. Time geography created some decades ago a conceptual framework for explaining and visualizing trajectories of people. However, the past decade witnessed a dramatic growth in the implementation of global positioning systems, smartphones, and other tracking technologies for collecting high-resolution space‚Äìtime data. As a result, a remarkable number of highly accurate trajectories are available for analysis and new ways of analyzing these space‚Äìtime data are being developed in order to better understand various geographical phenomena. Among them, sequence alignment methods are highly suitable for trajectories analysis in geography since unlike other quantitative methods for trajectories analysis, sequence alignment is concerned with the order (or sequence) of events.},

	abstract = {Shoreline and shelf-edge trajectories describe the migration through time of sedimentary systems, using geomorphological breaks-in-slope that are associated with key changes in depositional processes and products. Analysis of these trajectories provides a simple descriptive tool that complements and extends conventional sequence stratigraphic methods and models. Trajectory analysis offers four advantages over a sequence stratigraphic interpretation based on systems tracts: (1) each genetically related advance or retreat of a shoreline or shelf edge is viewed in the context of a continuously evolving depositional system, rather than as several discrete systems tracts; (2) subtle changes in depositional response (e.g. within systems tracts) can be identified and honoured; (3) trajectory analysis does not anticipate the succession of depositional events implied by systems-tract models; and (4) the descriptive emphasis of trajectory analysis does not involve any a priori assumptions about the type or nature of the mechanisms that drive sequence development. These four points allow the level of detail in a trajectory-based interpretation to be directly tailored to the available data, such that the interpretation may be qualitative or quantitative in two or three dimensions. Four classes of shoreline trajectory are recognized: ascending regressive, descending regressive, transgressive and stationary (i.e. nonmigratory). Ascending regressive and high-angle (accretionary) transgressive trajectories are associated with expanded facies belt thicknesses, the absence of laterally extensive erosional surfaces, and relatively high preservation of the shoreline depositional system. In contrast, descending regressive and low-angle (nonaccretionary) transgressive trajectories are associated with foreshortened and/or missing facies belts, the presence of laterally extensive erosional surfaces, and relatively low preservation of the shoreline depositional system. Stationary trajectories record shorelines positioned at a steeply sloping shelf edge, with accompanying bypass of sediment to the basin floor. Shelf-edge trajectories represent larger spatial and temporal scales than shoreline trajectories, and they can be subdivided into ascending, descending and stationary (i.e. nonmigratory) classes. Ascending trajectories are associated with a relatively large number and thickness of shoreline tongues (parasequences), the absence of laterally extensive erosional surfaces on the shelf, and relatively low sediment supply to the basin floor. Descending trajectories are associated with a few, thin shoreline tongues, the presence of laterally extensive erosional surfaces on the shelf, and high sediment supply to basin-floor fan systems. Stationary trajectories record near-total bypass of sediment across the shelf and mass transfer to the basin floor.},

	abstract = {The human body is made up of about 37 trillion cells (adults). Each cell has its own unique role and is affected by its neighboring cells and environment. The NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) aims at developing a 3D atlas of human body consisting of organs, vessels, tissues to singe cells with all 3D spatially registered in a single 3D human atlas using tissues obtained from normal individuals across a wide range of ages. A critical step of building the atlas is to register 3D tissue blocks in real-time to the right location of a human organ, which itself consists of complex 3D sub-structures. The complexity of the 3D organ model, e.g., 35 meshes for a typical kidney, poses a significant computational challenge for the registration. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework TICKET (TIssue bloCK rEgisTration) to support tissue block registration for 3D human atlas, including (1) 3D mesh pre-processing, (2) spatial queries on intersection relationship and (3) intersection volume computation between organs and tissue blocks. To minimize search space and computation cost, we develop multi-level indexing at both the anatomical structure level and mesh level, and utilize OpenMP for parallel computing. Considering cuboid based shape of the tissue block, we propose an efficient voxelization-based method to estimate the intersection volume. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient and practical. TICKET is being integrated into the HuBMAP CCF registration portal [1].},

In this study, we develop an agent-based model that simulates disaggregated pedestrian traffic flows at a regional scale.

These rules include activity type, mode, and route choices. The results of a case study in Salzburg (Austria) show traffic flows concentrated in the city centre and along the river. Performed complexity analysis justifies the structure and logic of the modelled system by showing improvements in results during the stepwise implementation of model concepts. We also performed uncertainty analysis to provide information on the accuracy of the modelled results, showing strong and moderate correlations against observational data.},

	abstract = {As increasing volumes of urban data are captured and become available, new opportunities arise for data-driven analysis that can lead to improvements in the lives of citizens through evidence-based decision making and policies. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important urban data set: taxi trips. Taxis are valuable sensors and information associated with taxi trips can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city life, from economic activity and human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these data presents many challenges. The data are complex, containing geographical and temporal components in addition to multiple variables associated with each trip. Consequently, it is hard to specify exploratory queries and to perform comparative analyses (e.g., compare different regions over time). This problem is compounded due to the size of the data-there are on average 500,000 taxi trips each day in NYC. We propose a new model that allows users to visually query taxi trips. Besides standard analytics queries, the model supports origin-destination queries that enable the study of mobility across the city. We show that this model is able to express a wide range of spatio-temporal queries, and it is also flexible in that not only can queries be composed but also different aggregations and visual representations can be applied, allowing users to explore and compare results. We have built a scalable system that implements this model which supports interactive response times; makes use of an adaptive level-of-detail rendering strategy to generate clutter-free visualization for large results; and shows hidden details to the users in a summary through the use of overlay heat maps. We present a series of case studies motivated by traffic engineers and economists that show how our model and system enable domain experts to perform tasks that were previously unattainable for them.},

Urban Life is a spatially explicit model to explore how urban form impacts agents‚Äô daily patterns of life. By meeting up at places agents form social networks, which in turn affect the places the agents visit. In our model, location and co-location affect all levels of decision making as agents prefer to visit nearby places. Co-location is necessary (but not sufficient) to connect agents in the social network. The Urban Life model was used in the Ground Truth program as a virtual world testbed to produce data in a setting in which the underlying ground truth was explicitly known. Data was provided to research teams to test and validate Human Domain research methods to an extent previously impossible. This paper summarizes our Urban Life model‚Äôs design and simulation along with a description of how it was used to test the ability of Human Domain research teams to predict future states and to prescribe changes to the simulation to achieve desired outcomes in our simulated world.},

	abstract = {A taxi stand can effectively regulate the behavior of taxi picking up passengers, reduce empty-run rate, and provide a convenient and orderly waiting environment for the public. However, the unreasonable setting of the existing taxi stands in most cities leads to an extremely low utilization rate and a waste of public space resources. This paper presents a novel three-stage strategy to address the taxi stands location problem (TSLP) incrementally. First, taxi demands hotspots are mined from a massive taxi Global Positioning System (GPS) data with GIS platform, and the optimal area for taxi stands siting in the following stages is determined. Then, the spatial interaction between taxi demands and taxi stands is explored to generate demand subsections and stand candidates along both the sides of the road. At last, a taxi stand location model (TSLM) is developed to minimize the total cost, which contains the access cost of passengers and the construction cost of taxi stands. The genetic algorithm-based procedure is adopted for TSLM optimization. A case study conducted in China verifies the effectiveness of the location strategy and investigate the impact of the maximum acceptable distance for passengers on TSLP. The experimental results describe the number and layout of taxi stand under a different demand coverage, which indicates that the proposed approach is beneficial to provide scientific reference for the municipal department in taxi stand site decisions and make a tradeoff between the interests of planners and users.},

	abstract = {Fleet sizing is critical for shared autonomous vehicle(SAV) fleet management to reduce maintenance costs and traffic congestions. As the passenger demands are dynamic, how to make the demand-aware dynamic ridesharing and calculate the fleet size is an important and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a minimum fleet sizing method called Fleet Sizing for demand-aware Dynamic Ridesharing (FSDR) to accurately determine the fleet size for ridesharing enabled SAV system. Specifically, the travel demands are first predicted by an ensemble method that takes account of temporal correlations between regions. Then a concept called demand utility is proposed to measure the travel demands when planning vehicle paths, and the ride-matching dispatches vehicles to high travel demand regions by maximizing the demand utility along the vehicle path. Based on the ride-matching result, the minimum fleet size is calculated based on a trip graph by the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. FSDR is evaluated on two real GPS taxi trajectory datasets from Wuhan, China, and San Francisco, USA. The result validates that the proposed demand-aware ridesharing in FSDR can significantly reduce the fleet size compared to the existing ride-matching methods. Moreover, the result shows that by allowing ridesharing, the vehicle fleet size can be reduced by 30\%.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in our digital lives, from recommending products on e-commerce websites to suggesting movies and music on streaming platforms. Existing recommendation datasets, such as Amazon Product Reviews and MovieLens, greatly facilitated the research and development of recommender systems in their respective domains. While the number of mobile users and applications (aka apps) has increased exponentially over the past decade, research in mobile app recommender systems has been significantly constrained, primarily due to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, as opposed to recommendations for products, movies, and news. To facilitate research for app recommendation systems, we introduce a large-scale dataset, called MobileRec. We constructed MobileRec from users' activity on the Google play store. MobileRec contains 19.3 million user interactions (i.e., user reviews on apps) with over 10K unique apps across 48 categories. MobileRec records the sequential activity of a total of 0.7 million distinct users. Each of these users has interacted with no fewer than five distinct apps, which stands in contrast to previous datasets on mobile apps that recorded only a single interaction per user. Furthermore, MobileRec presents users' ratings as well as sentiments on installed apps, and each app contains rich metadata such as app name, category, description, and overall rating, among others. We demonstrate that MobileRec can serve as an excellent testbed for app recommendation through a comparative study of several state-of-the-art recommendation approaches. The MobileRec dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/recmeapp/mobilerec.},

	abstract = {With the ubiquitous use of location enabled devices, pattern discovery in trajectories has been receiving increasing interest. Among such patterns, we have queries related to how groups of moving objects behave over time such as discovering flocks. A flock pattern is defined as a set of moving objects that move within a predefined distance to each other for a given continuous period of time. A typical application example is surveillance, where relies on discovering flocks on very large streaming spatiotemporal data efficiently. Previous work presented a polynomial solution to the problem of finding flocks with fixed time duration. And presented as well a set of algorithms based on this solution, which are the state-of-the-art algorithms regarding this problem. In this paper, we improve those algorithms by applying the plane sweeping technique in conjunction to an inverted index. The plane sweeping accelerates the detection of groups of objects that are candidates to be a flock in a time instant and the inverted index is used to compare candidate disks across time instants quickly. Using an assortment of real-world trajectory datasets, we show that our proposed methods are very efficient. When compared with the baseline flock algorithm, our proposed methods achieved up to 46x speedup reducing the elapsed time from thousands of seconds to milliseconds.},

With such data, important information can be retrieved, where co-movement patterns stand out in finding groups of moving objects moving together. However, such pattern mining algorithms are not simple and commonly require non-trivial fixed parameters as input, which are extremely dependent on the data domain and also impacted by many others context variables, being such challenging task also to domain specialists. One example of these patterns is the flock pattern that has as its most challenging parameter the distance threshold that is the size of the disks that involves the objects. Although other density-based approaches reduce the impact of the restrictions of the disk, all of them still require a distance parameter for the density connectedness. Addressing this problem, we introduce the concept of discovering of k-co-movement patterns, which is finding the top-k patterns, according to the desired raking criterion. Especially for the flock pattern, we also define a new flock pattern query and propose a top-down algorithm with free distance parameter for the aforementioned problem.},

These systems can be roughly categorized into Apache Hadoop-based and in-memory systems based on Apache Spark. The available features supported by these systems vary widely. However, there has not been any comprehensive evaluation study of these systems in terms of performance, scalability and functionality. To address this need, we propose a benchmark to evaluate Big Spatial Data systems. Although, Spark is a very popular framework, its performance is limited by the overhead associated with distributed resource management and coordination. The Big Spatial Data systems that are based on Spark, are also constrained by these. We introduce SpatialIgnite, a Big Spatial Data system that we have developed based on Apache Ignite. We investigate the present status of the Big Spatial Data systems by conducting a comprehensive feature analysis and performance evaluation of a few representative systems with our benchmark.

	abstract = {Movement analysis has become an integral part of many disciplines, yet with relatively little overlap. A foresight paper in this journal entitled ‚ÄúTowards an integrated science of movement: converging research on animal movement ecology and human mobility science‚Äù argued for a better integration of concepts across the divide of animal and human movement, which would lead to the Integrated Science of Movement, but did so from a top-down perspective based on a series of expert workshops. We argue that for a solid establishment of the Integrated Science of Movement, a bottom-up approach is necessary, one based on existing literature which identifies similarities and differences across disciplines. We therefore review, compare, and contrast movement analysis methodologies from GIScience, movement ecology, geography, transportation, public health, computer science, and physics. We structure our review along the dichotomy of individual versus population-based movement or, using terminology from wildlife ecology, between the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives. We further introduce a new unifying framework for movement research that is sufficiently general to cover any type of movement study in any discipline and that spans the Lagrangian/Eulerian divide, with the ambitious goal to bridge the gap between disciplines and lay a solid foundation for a new Integrated Science of Movement.},

	abstract = {Regions of anomalous spatial co-locations (ROASCs) are regions where co-locations between two different features are significantly stronger or weaker than expected. ROASC discovery can provide useful insights for studying unexpected spatial associations at regional scales. The main challenges are that the ROASCs are spatially arbitrary in geographic shape and the distributions of spatial features are unknown a priori. To avoid restrictive assumptions regarding the distribution of data, we propose a distribution-free method for discovering arbitrarily shaped ROASCs. First, we present a multidirectional optimization method to adaptively identify the candidate ROASCs, whose sizes and shapes are fully endogenized. Furthermore, the validity of the candidates is evaluated through significance tests under the null hypothesis that the expected spatial co-locations between two features occur consistently across space. To effectively model the null hypothesis, we develop a bivariate pattern reconstruction method by reconstructing the spatial auto- and cross-correlation structures observed in the data. Synthetic experiments and a case study conducted using Shanghai taxi datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method, in terms of effectiveness, over an available alternative method.},

The program code is presented and analyzed to show how small changes in implementation can have a drastic effect on performance. The computational study demonstrates how problem features and hardware platforms influence algorithm behaviour. The effect of vertex ordering is investigated. One of the algorithms (MCS) is broken into its constituent parts and we discover that one of these parts frequently degrades performance. It is shown that the standard procedure used for rescaling published results (i.e., adjusting run times based on the calibration of a standard program over a set of benchmarks) is unsafe and can lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn from empirical data.},

	abstract = {One of the ongoing problems researchers in geography and GIS have is studying data that is inherently spatial over a long period of time. One of the main hurdles they have to overcome is the study of groups of people classified by their socio-economic status (one of the main means for governments, companies and research organisations to group together segments of the population).The amount of data collected by governments, business and research organisations has increased markedly in recent years. Geographic Information Systems have been more widely used than ever before for the storage and analysis of this information. Most GIS can handle this information spatially rather than temporally, and have difficulty with the management of socio-economic time series, which relate to spatial units. Accordingly, this book covers the issues ranging from the formal model to differentiate aspects of spatio-temporal data, through philosophical and fundamental reconsideration of time and space to the development of practical solutions to the problem. This book draws together an interdisciplinary group of scientists in the field of geography, computing, surveying and philosophy. It presents the definitive sourcebook on temporal GIS as applied to socio-economic units.},

Groups are defined as sets of MPOs that are directly or transitively related to each other via freely definable binary relations. Group candidates are identified within a snapshot view of the MPOs at discrete time instances. By backtracking over previous snapshots, stable group compositions over previous time instances are identified and reported. We give insight about the used data structures and algorithms for the group candidate calculation and backtracking steps and illustrate the approach's functionality with examples from a real data set.},

However, less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern) using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land use map to identify job‚Äìhousing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for jobs‚Äìhousing identification and the other for commuting trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.},

Path models are learnt from the accumulation of trajectory data over long time periods, and can be used to augment the classification of subsequent track data. In particular, labelled paths provide an efficient means for compressing the trajectory data for logging purposes. In addition, the model can be used to compute a probabilistic prediction of the pedestrian's location many time steps ahead, and to aid the recognition of unusual behaviour identified as atypical object motion.},

We assume that the user movement data are collected by logging location data emitted from mobile devices tracking users. We formally define group pattern as a group of users that are within a distance threshold from one another for at least a minimum duration. To mine group patterns, we first propose two algorithms, namely AGP and VG-growth. In our first set of experiments, it is shown when both the number of users and logging duration are large, AGP and VG-growth are inefficient for the mining group patterns of size two. We therefore propose a framework that summarizes user movement data before group pattern mining. In the second series of experiments, we show that the methods using location summarization reduce the mining overheads for group patterns of size two significantly. We conclude that the cuboid based summarization methods give better performance when the summarized database size is small compared to the original movement database. In addition, we also evaluate the impact of parameters on the mining overhead.},

	title = {A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise},
	year = {1996},
	publisher = {AAAI Press},
	abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},
