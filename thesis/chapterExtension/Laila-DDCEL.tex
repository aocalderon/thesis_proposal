\section{Scalable Polygon Extraction for Line-based Input} \label{sec:polygonization}

Our discussion so far assumed the input data is a set of clean and closed polygons in the two input layers to be overlayed. However, several real-world 
polygons, such as city blocks formed by individual road segments represented as spatial lines, are unavailable in the polygonal form. Forming polygons in such 
cases at a large scale is non-trivial and takes significant computing cost. This section further extends our scalable DCEL overlay operations to handle 
scattered line segments as input through a scalable polygonization \cite{abdelhafeez_ddcel_2023} process. Such a feature enables spatial data scientists to 
seamlessly  
exploit a rich set of publicly available datasets, e.g., spatial road networks worldwide \cite{web:data:continents,web:data:usa}.

Building a DCEL data structure from an input of planar line segments extracts all closed polygons during the invocation of the \textit{polygonization} 
procedure.  In our work in \cite{abdelhafeez_ddcel_2023}, we proposed a scalable distributed framework to build a DCEL and extract polygons in parallel from 
the 
input 
line segments. Figure \ref{fig:overview_ddcel} shows an overview of the DCEL constructor. 

To create a DCEL data structure from input line segments, the \textit{DCEL constructor} undergoes a two-phase paradigm.  The \textit{Gen Phase}, detailed in 
Section \ref{sec:gen}, spatially partitions the input lines, generating the subdivision's vertices ($V$) and half-edges ($H$), and a subset of the 
subdivision's faces ($F_0$). 

The remaining line segments that are not assigned to a face yet are passed to the subsequent phase in the form of half-edges or incomplete cycles. An 
incomplete 
cycle is a connected half-edge list that is a candidate face. The \textit{Rem Phase}, detailed in Section \ref{sec:rem}, generates the subdivision's remaining 
faces, $F_j, \ \forall j > 0$. 

Section \ref{sec:partitioning_ddcel} discusses different data re-partitioning schemes with a minimal number of iterations to reduce the workload of the 
\textit{Rem Phase} without compromising correctness. The polygonization procedure produces two outputs: first, a set of closed polygons formed by the input 
planar line segments, and second, any edges that are not a part of any polygon, i.e., dangle or cut edges. Overlaying the polygons generated with any polygon 
layer follows the approaches discussed in sections \ref{sec:methods}and \ref{sec:alternative_methods}. In section \ref{sec:over_dang}, we extend the overlay 
approaches to handle overlaying a polygon layer with the remaining edges (the dangle and cut edges).

The polygonization procedure produces two outputs: first, a set of closed polygons formed by the input planar line segments, and second, any edges that are not 
a part of any polygon, i.e., dangle or cut edges. 
Overlaying the polygons generated with any polygon layer follows the approaches discussed in sections \ref{sec:methods} and \ref{sec:alternative_methods}.
However, we need to modify the algorithms provided in these previous sections to overlay an input polygon layer $A$ with the dangle and cut edges, i.e. layer 
$B$. In particular, we modify the reduce phase.
Figure \ref{fig:dangleoverlay:input} illustrates the spatial partitioning of the two input layers, $A$ and $B$. Layer $A$ contains two input polygons, $A_0$ and 
$A_1$, while Layer $B$ consists of three dangle edges, $B_0$, $B_1$, and $B_2$.

Each edge from layer $B$ is labeled a unique label and is fed as an input to the overlay module.
The local overlay is performed by finding intersections between the input polygon layer $A$ and layer $B$ on each data partition.
If a polygon with $id = i$ from polygon layer $A$ intersects with edges with ids $id = a, id = b, id = c$ from layer $B$ at some data partition, we generate a 
label to match these intersections $A_{i} B_{a} B_{b} B_{c}$. 
At the reduce phase, we re-partition the data by the first label, meaning we collect all edges that intersect with the first label.
If two data partitions produced the labels $A_{i} B_{a} B_{b} B_{c}$ and $A_{i} B_{x} B_{y}$, we repartition the data such that $A_{i}$ is on one partition with 
all edges it is intersecting, i.e., $B_{a}, B_{b}, B_{c}, B_{x}, B_{y}$.
In Figure \ref{fig:dangleoverlay:inter}, Polygon $A_0$ is re-partitioned along with the edges it intersects, specifically $B_0$, $B_1$, and $B_2$.

After re-partitioning the data, we have all edges from both layers intersecting each other on the same partition. The next step is to find the polygons 
generated by these intersections. Since there is no guarantee that only one polygon is generated, we substitute the polygon concatenation proposed in 
Section~\ref{sec:reduce} by performing \textit{polygonization} on each partition. The polygonization procedure ensures it generates all new possible polygons. 
The polygonization procedure follows the algorithm mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:gen}. It starts with generating the new vertices and half-edges, then marking 
the current dangles and cut edges, then setting the next pointers and finally generating the partition polygons.
Figure \ref{fig:dangleoverlay:result} shows the result of polygonizing the edges from Polygon $A_0$ and $B_0$, $B_1$, and $B_2$, resulting in two polygons, 
$A_01$ and $A_02$.

Polygons from all partitions generate the overlay between the polygon layer $A$ and layer $B$.
