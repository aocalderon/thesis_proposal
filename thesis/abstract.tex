The Doubly Connected Edge List (DCEL) is an edge-list structure that has been widely utilized in spatial applications for planar topological computations.
An important operation is the \textit{overlay} which combines the DCELs of two input layers and can easily support spatial queries like the intersection, union
 and difference between these layers.
Here we propose a distributed and scalable way to compute the overlay operation and its related supported queries.
Previous sequential implementations do not scale and fail to complete for large datasets (for example the US census tracks).
We address the issues involved in distributing the overlay operator and offer various optimizations.
Using real datasets, our scalable solution can compute the overlay of very large datasets (32M edges) in few minutes.
