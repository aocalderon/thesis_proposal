\chapter{Conclusions}
We introduced SDCEL, a scalable approach to compute the overlay operation among two layers that represent polygons from a planar subdivision of a surface. Both 
input layers use the DCEL edge-list data structure to store their polygons. Existing sequential DCEL overlay implementations fail for large datasets. We first 
presented a partition strategy which guarantees that each partition collects the required data from each layer to work independently. 
We also proposed several optimizations to improve performance. Our experimental evaluation using real datasets shows that SDCEL has very good scale-up and 
speed-up performance and can compute the overlay over very large layers (up to 37M edges) in few seconds.
