\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
We present a novel, scalable approach to discovering moving flock patterns in large trajectory databases. By leveraging distributed frameworks, the proposed method overcomes the limitations of sequential algorithms that struggle with large-scale spatio-temporal datasets. Through partitioning and replication, as well as improvements in pruning and temporal joins, this approach efficiently handles dense data, offering significant performance improvements over traditional methods. The evaluation results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach, making it a valuable contribution for analyzing complex movement patterns.
